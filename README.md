# NewsApp
## Designed the Instagram Flavor News app based on Google Component Architectural MVVM Pattern.
1. Implemented the bottom bar & page navigation using JetPack navigation component.
2. Utilized 3rd party CardStackView (RecyclerView) to support swipe gestures for liking/disliking the news.
3. Built the Room Database with LiveData & ViewModel to support local cache and offline model.
4. Integrated Retrofit and LiveData to pull the latest news data from a 3rd party RESTful endpoint (newsapi.org).
